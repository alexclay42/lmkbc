The user wants to improve a prompt that's supposed to give examples of entities and relations to generate the tail entity. The original variable is a question-answer pair where the question is about Kristin von der Goltz's mother, and the answer is linked directly to the entity and relation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the role of the variable. It's a prompt for generating examples, so the examples should be clear and structured. The original example might be too vague. The feedback isn't provided, but the user mentioned there's context and feedback. Since the context is empty, maybe the main issue is making the prompt more explicit.\n\nThe original prompt has a question with a hashtag indicating the relation, like \"# mother\". The answer is a name, but it's cut off. To improve this, the prompt should guide the user to provide both the entity and the relation, and maybe specify that the answer should be the tail entity. Also, maybe adding examples would help. For instance, showing how the relation connects the head entity to the tail entity.\n\nSo, the improved prompt should ask for examples where each example includes the head entity, the relation, and the tail entity. Maybe structure it as \"Provide examples of [head entity] and [relation] to generate the tail entity.\" Then, the answer would be the tail entity. The original example might need to be more explicit about the relation and the tail entity. Also, ensuring that the answer is directly linked to the given entity and relation, as mentioned in the original text.\n\nI should make sure the prompt is clear and provides a template for the user to follow. Maybe using bullet points or a specific format. Also, the original answer is cut off, so the improved version should have a complete example. For instance, if the head is Kristin von der Goltz and the relation is mother, the tail would be her mother's name. So the example should show that structure.\n</think>\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>Q: Provide examples of [head entity] and [relation] to generate the tail entity.  \nA: For example, if the head entity is \"Kristin von der Goltz\" and the relation is \"mother,\" the tail entity would be \"Kirsti (...)\" (complete the name).
